Every language ever assembly a low-level programming language allowing here Wow, we went did this thing does not This is dead serious. Okay, 15 minutes every single language every single language ever I cannot wait to hear about everybody's favorite language synergy Okay, we've got to start with assembly it makes sense It's to give instructions to the computer's hardware you see computers can only do things in terms of zero or one So assembly was created in order to make computer instructions more workable for human beings This works by using an assembler that translates the human readable code into ones and zeros Assembly is one of the world's first pro almost a canisa's keyboard It's almost a canisa's keyboard back in the 60s this thing time traveled This thing has time traveled look at this look at this guy this guy was pro this guy was raw dog and zeros and ones into a computer long before You did anything, okay? You and your JavaScript Okay, this is what this is what a senior dev looks like This is what jack black in an alternative universe looks like Gaming languages it used to be the standard to run super computers back in the day But you still find it used currently to work with CPU memory and it's used sometimes in browsers via web assembly Fortran one of Huh Ha Web assembly and assembly are different just saying they're different the world's first high level languages the difference between a high level language and a low level Language was for trend the world's first high level language. I thought I thought algo algo algo Algo When did algo I thought algo 69 okay and Fortran oh What about the Z the Z1 language? That was like 1930 1940 yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I thought the Z1 was considered like One of the most modern computers with with with with bullying logic and stuff like that I thought that was like one of the I thought that was like the first is first is but okay, okay Fortran did are aren't you tired of being wrong? No, I never am tired of being wrong Never be tired of being wrong. Okay. I'm a programmer If you're not ready to argue Ususly for hours over things that don't even matter then you're not ready to be a programmer When you can manipulate the computer's memory much more directly It also executes much faster than a high level language the drama is is that it's much harder to learn a high level language Is much easier to understand and as a lot of it used much for the total of how hard it is Fortran was created by IBM in the 1950s the name stands for formula translator programming and Fortran would be done by using a punch card Then would be fed into a card reader and would be translated into code that the computer can understand this translating process is called Compiling which basically changes the code that humans can read I can't tell you how many stories I heard in college for my Professors about punch cards and they said the worst of all of the things that happened with punch cards is when you're walking to the machine And one of them told me a story about how they tripped and it was like 25 50 punch cards some large amount tripped and Just threw out all the punch cards just just let them fly had to redo your entire Program from scratch because you tripped imagine just imagine that for a second quick sort this you filthy casual I know Hand number every card skill issue you did have to like that was kind of the that was The lesson as you hand number the cards Imagine not numbering them. I know what you did imagine numbering something Imagine living that life where to quick sort come from let's see is that where quick sort came from that is where quick quick Quick sort came from a dude that made quick sort and then was like wow I think I figured out a fast way to do sorting showed his boss and his boss is like you just invented the fastest sort ever And it was the fastest sort ever into the ones and zeros computers can understand you just come Just also known as commercial translator is another programming language what the hell did I just hear? We're getting on the come train Damn, I did not I did not know that come train was one come train also known as Well anyways, we're on to the come train. Let's go commercial translator is another programming language developed by IBM It served as the business equivalent to Is come train is this like the precursor to cobalt is this precursor? Is this comor language? Fortran in which for trend was used for a scientific computing It was influenced by another programming language called flomatic a programming language for data processing that ran on this giant Super computer called the Univac one list also known as a list processing was created soon after for trend It's known for using a lot of parentheses in its code. It was an innovative fair. That is probably the most fair statement ever For Lisp is what is Lisp's known for a lot of parentheses I think today it would probably say that Lisp is best known for the fact that it runs the world's greatest operating system Emax, but it's also fair to say it's just a lot of parentheses Language which inspired these concepts and programming cobalt standing for common business. It was an innovative language which inspired Tree data structures recursion. I feel like Recursion had to be really you're telling me tree data structures weren't invented until Lisp or recursion or higher order functions or dynamic typing or Conditionals or self-hosting compiler Is that all true? Sus Yes What what nope f-boys. Yes, what? Okay, no one else and programming cobalt standing for common business oriented language Was the programming language developed in 1959 for you best it businesses even though it was made so long ago It is still used today. Proper right-range institutions to process transactions the code By the way, it is wild that our financial system Runs on this language like we all just need to take a second and recognize the fact That our entire financial stability is ran on cobalt It's utterly wild. It must be the most secure language ever It's because you have the right English. You can't hack English. It's too hard Nobody can hack English, okay? Ain't nobody got time to hack English. It's too hard to do looks like plain English sentences But this would later be translated onto a punch card one of the first adopters of the language was the US Department of Defense IBM RPG IBM report program, you know for all fairness, okay? The American government is quick to innovate and Then stops all forms of innovation and forever are frozen at a specific time I don't know what it is like the SEC Part of its XBRL experience for after the what's it called after the financial collapse and and Ron screwing all the peoples XBRL was developed. I forget exactly what it stands for But it was HTML 3.2 bleeding edge at that point and then they just never updated it ever again And now there's like this entire arcane separate language called XBRL to file your 10 9 or your 10ks and your 10 q's and all that crap for The financial system to prevent and Ron from ever happening again. I don't know it just exists Generator is a programming language created by IBM meant to run on IBM systems It's one of the only programming language to make use of rows and columns for its code Algo 60 short for algorithmic language in 1960 is not a very well-known programming language But is one of the languages that inspired one of the most well-known programming languages in the world see it was also one of the first English to use nested functions APL standing for nested functions What a good time It's such a good time until it's not a good time, but it's a good time I just made one this morning and I feel pretty proud of it. Let's go APL a programming language You know if anyone ever tells you naming is is not hard just remember that You had somebody who just finally gave up and was like It's just a programming language, okay? That's it a programming language first appeared in the 1960s is a programming language developed for Mathematical equations mostly algebra it uses a lot of math and Greek symbols directly in the code programming language me I can't use the language that requires symbols, okay? Do you imagine having to use that? Imagine actually having to use that like I mean I know I complain a lot about java script java script I love it, but like just a math skill issue you're a skill issue Many decades ago that was one of the world's first object oriented language object oriented programming is We for programmers to use blocks of codes that are is that j query is are we looking at j query right now? Oh gosh, we are looking at so many j queries right now. We are so j queried out Why would you do a dot count each and not pass in the element? Oh, yeah, that's because this is the element. I forgot j query. Where's the indenting you son of a bitch j query Where's your indenting the indenting is just making me so angry right now? I just I couldn't even read the code I couldn't even read the code what is j query you wouldn't understand, okay? You probably a react Andy You don't get it you don't know it if you don't know j query you don't know shit Useable and can interact with each other instead of pure functions and logic in object oriented programming use blocks of code called objects By the way using j query as an example for object oriented code is that was kind of wild I would have tossed out like Simula as the example because that's the language we're currently covering or like Java 1.6 Okay, j query is not a great example This is not a great example of object oriented code Objects are created by things called the classes which contain properties and can use methods to explain it simply You can create a class called pokemon name the object charmander give it properties such as fire type and allow it to execute methods such as flamethrower and scratch Speaky I'm super confused I thought pokie main was a popular female streamer. Is she a furry now? Is that what happened? Give my broke boys tell me Broke boys can you tell me about How good are the cookies tell me real talk Who here bought the cookies? I bet you one of you sons of bitches bought a cookie Press one in the chat if you actually bought a cookie come on let it out just it's okay No one's gonna feel bad no one's gonna feel bad if you bought a cookie. Let's go. Let's go We see some ones coming in let's go You know what I'm not offended at all by the way for anyone that bought one of her cookies Let's go Let's go you guys aren't broke boys, but I did notice something that kind of hurt my feelings all the people who pressed one which was about seven None of you guys are subscribers to me. I know you're not broke boys. Okay $5 a month. Did you tell me you have countless hours of time? Easy programming language that was mainly used by physicist in the 60s But you're using a colon underscore in its code basic the beginners all purpose That seems like a strange thing to be known for speak easy What oh by the way basic let's go basic instruction code was created at Dartmouth in 1963 It was created with the purpose of getting the average layperson to be able to learn how to code You see before that time programming had only been the domain of scientists and mathematicians Okay, first off That you see this entire math scene is not making any sense. Okay What are all these people doing on a whiteboard? Okay, this doesn't make any sense. There's a person right here Which you can barely see there's a person in the background. There's this guy And this person is holding a pencil Like this this scene doesn't make any sense who who brings a pencil to a chalkboard Nobody brings a pencil to a chalkboard That time programming had only been the domain of scientists and mathematicians This was because of its easy to understand syntax syntax is basically the rules to writing in a programming language Mumps mumps aka the Massachusetts general Mumps also known for how fun it is much like the disease Hospital utility moby programming system or sometimes just M for short was created to manage hospital laboratory information systems That's right. I've heard about this Mumps I've heard about this. I forgot who just told me this. I want to say it was TJ But yes mumps the classic language For hospitals it was also used to manage electronic health records It's code tends to be very terse which means you can take most of its word commands and abbreviate them into simple short letters logo and You know what I you know what I mean you can take most of its word commands and abbreviate I don't want to have to be typing all that shit my life. Okay. I just want to be able to just get things done Dear goodness and S and T i k q s i Quit set if kill kid quit set if String K that's crazy. Hey, thank you Mario. I appreciate that you're going in a YouTube video. Thank you Mario I appreciate the 10 gifted subs They're meant to simple short letters logo an educational programming language made in 60s which makes use of what is known as a turtle graphic Not an actual turtle. We read about the name of the cursor used to draw geometric shapes as determined by the code Pascal a programming language that was very popular Even the default Pascal many computers back in the day It was one of the first programming language to be used by an IDE which is an integrated development environment Basically a dedicated program to write its code one of the most well-known programs created with Pascal was Photoshop See a program Really Photoshop wow, okay. Hey, whoa, whoa. Hey I mean, that's that's pretty impressive actually. I didn't know that okay the more you know people the more you know wow, okay Okay, see what's created in the 70s see is the greatest language of all time obviously the foundation of computer science This is one of the most popular programming languages of all time created that bell labs. It is the basis why is bell labs Where all the good things came out of notice that IBM created all those stupid languages like RPG RPG nobody's ever even heard of it and then bell labs is they they came up with the octo Thorpe okay, that's pretty useful Um, they came up with C They have a lot of things Many operating systems such as windows and linux it also inspired many programming languages that came after it such as C++ C sharp Objective C grow Java JavaScript PHP Typhon and many more its known for its low-level access to the computer's memory by using code called pointers Computer memory was much more of a finite resource in the past so programmers had to be much more careful about how they allocated it Otherwise, it'll cause problems such as memory leaks which is basically when This is a fact of life Somehow we still memory leak in JavaScript, but that's not the point okay. The point is is that You could also memory leak in not JavaScript. It's just you know, it's just thing. It's just thing that would happen If you don't get it you don't get it. I get it. You know, it's confusing. Okay um, you know The days of limited RAM. I don't miss them But at the same time You really had to think about things you know what I mean? I Wonder if we had less of a RAM appetite would we have better software? I don't know if that's true You know what I mean? I think some people like to I think people like to imagine that it's true But I'm not sure if it's actually true Like take the Nintendo 64 not a lot of memory right not a not a ton and Turrock rage wars. Turrock by the way The you could only get 49 out of 50 medals because there's just a bug and they ship the game anyways and I'm still hurt by it 1010. Oh Right, I'm still hurt by it. There's plenty of shitty software that existed in the 90s So I'm not sure if somehow that's a real problem And programs use up too much memory in your computer causing the computer to become Slowly slow small talk a programming language in the 70s that was known for its object oriented programming It inspired me object oriented programming languages that came out of the blog known as the first logic programming language It is known for being modeled after formal logic in philosophy ML also known as meta-language pioneered statically typed functional programming Which basically means giving information certain types such as strings integers floats or bullions strings Are just words and letters integers or whole numbers floats are real Look at me shake my head. Okay, Haskell mentioned. I understand. I understand that Haskell Haskell's granddaddy is over here. I don't want to hear about the ml languages. Okay, get him out of here Shagot. We're shaking. Don't worry. Can we go back to can we get back to C sharp, please? Bullion is something that can be either true or false SQL SQL also known as if he does not say squeal here. I'm not going to be very happy Structured query language also even called sequel is a language used for creating and managing databases You store information in things called tables and structure them with rows and columns The code also looks like planning and gull sentences It is used by many systems even today to store their data such as usernames and passwords transactions By the way Notice that he didn't even mention CSS the alternative to sequel like what what are we what are we supposed to do without CSS Don't information and more basically think of it as the system of excel spreadsheets C++ an extension of the C programming language the major difference is C++ has object oriented programming Unlike the original C which didn't it's also known for its steep learning curve C++ is one of the most important programming languages of all time even still in wide use today still being the Was that the Toby index the long time even still in I'm pretty sure we talked about this This is the Toby index Don't listen to them, but C++ should be pretty high up C++ is used everywhere I mean C++ is is is extremely important language and whether you hate it or love it It's still it's still very very popular Toby did get this one right. Okay. Toby's piece shit But Toby got this right why it used today still being the main programming language and creating operating systems web browsers databases and games Ada a programming language made in the 1980s that is mainly used named after Ada Lovelace You know, I always feel bad about Charles Babbage Because like yo dog he also he he He like made the the analytical machine, but ain't nobody given him any credit right They're always just like oh Ada Lovelace and you're just like you that's half the team dog Why you gotta always shit on Babbage? What where's the love for Babbage? But there's no love for Ada or there's all the love for Ada, but no love for Babbage It's it's it ain't fair. It ain't fair But the US Department of Defense it is named after the credited world's first programmer Ada Lovelace Matlab Matlab or Matrix Library is a mathematics program. Ain't no Babbage there I mean Babbage is like Intel makes a sweet piece of machinery here Ada does a little bit of programming on it and they're just like man, it is so cool You're just like yo dog maybe they're both pretty awesome. You ever thought about that? Language is still I'm still upset about this And engineers, I'm upset about A mathematics based programming language that can be used for statistics, robotics, and artificial Nobody cares about math It's still widely used today mainly by Apple and E's Objective C A programming one I hate Objective C, I wrote Falcorn Objective C It took me like four weeks, I had to write a multi-threaded, it was the worst experience I've ever had The end A language inspired by C that was created in the 1980s Which became the main language for Apple computers Even being the main language for the early iPhones Although its popularity has fallen over the years Mainly due to Apple replacing it by a newer programming language called Swift in the mid-2020s Let's go Abuse Made by National Instruments in the 1980s It is a programming language that doesn't really use traditional code Instead it's a graphical programming language where you build user interfaces Ah scratch 1.0 Okay Okay We've seen scratch We've seen scratch using images Erlang A programming language Okay, Rhinegh Winchester If you're in here please You're allowed to now spam Rhinegh Winchester You're now allowed to do Erlang mentioned Let's go Beam Go to Beams Designed for the telecom Erlang Erlang A language that was designed to work very well with text It's used for system administration, network programming Is that a paint or a paint or a paint? More Perlin's been known as a product tape that holds the internet together If you've ever seen the code It actually looks pretty wacky Wolfram Created by Steven Wolfram It's a language that can perform data visualization Image processing, mathematics And pretty much anything you can think of It can even tell you the shortest route around Europe Haskell It's a functional It did a Euclidean circuit or whatever it's called Is it a Euclidean circuit? What's the name of the one where you start and end at the same place To go visit everything with the shortest path Good guys Okay, guys A Euler circuit There you go Euler circuit Or Euler Euler Euler circuit That's an NP-complete problem Eulerian cycle Hamiltonian cycle Euler Euler Euler Euler is he rich? That's how he pronounced Euler is Euler Euler Euler Is it a Hamiltonian path? I always forget which one it is Anyways, let's keep on going Haskell matches Let's go Haskell Variables being immutable Which means you can't change them The language is based on lambda calculus Visual There we go That's about all you need to know about Haskell Okay That's called its abstract If you want to find any applications Haskell you're going to have to go look in a white paper Database Well basic A programming language developed by Microsoft in the early 90s It's used to create Microsoft programs and applications By using GYs or graphical user interfaces Basically, anything you can interact with with your mouse on the screen Is part of the graphical user interface Are you showing us an apple? This is like old apple right here This is Macintosh Macintosh Yeah, Visual Basic is a curse and a plague upon the earth It also has a very popular IDE of the same name Lua A language known to Let's go, Lua For its speed and being able to be embedded into other programs It's also known for being very easy to learn Delphi Literally miss the most important part of Lua Brazil mentioned Let's go Let's go Brazil Let's go Brazil Let's go Brazil Right? Like, dude Didn't even mention the fact that it's a Brazilian Stance from moon Did you know it's moon Lua Lua Nothing much to say about it It's basically Pascal But with object oriented programming It even comes with its own code editor Okamal Okamal is a functional based programming language Like Haskell and Erling Functional programming languages are good at doing math And object oriented programming languages are good for building Enterprise level software Python Python is a general Oh damn it He just do what I think he just did Did he just do what I think he just did Chats Chats malding We got we We Chats I've never seen chat ball this hard my entire lifetime What have you done? You cannot possibly say that You're not wrong but you can't say that out loud You can ship people you can get so upset Purpose programming language And you can use it to make pretty much anything From desktop applications to websites Creating bots or API Handling servers and databases Game development, image processing Statistics And so much more that it would need its own That's Python for you Python It does it It does it Except for for loops Don't do for loops Don't do for loops Ok We use we use numpy for for loops Ok Video Python is currently one of the most popular programming languages For creating AI It's also one of the most popular programming languages in general In fact Most beginner programmers start with Python As their first programming language Not only for its vast utility But also how easy it is to learn One of its only job I think that that's probably changing a lot today I bet you the next generation of programmers Those that are somewhere between 9 to 13 There are two languages are going to be scratch and lua They're going to be making so many Roblox games The reality is I think lua is going to be one of the largest One of the largest initial programming languages out there Scratch is a great first language for kids They get to understand kind of like the basic concepts Set up loops and all that And then it goes from there Waiting for Rust to be mentioned Rust will be the next one That tends to be pretty slow compared to other programming languages Like C++ Ruby Ruby is a language very similar to Python Even the code looks similar I think we renamed Ruby to DHHLang Dintwee Ruby is easy to learn And the code is also very readable One of the most popular uses of Ruby Is to combine it with a framework called on rails To create websites Adopting the full name Ruby on rails Ruby on rails Currently the backbone to many websites we know currently such as Hulu Airbnb Coinbase He really came in hard with that Hulu Hulu I didn't realize Kickstarter her r- I mean, Heroku GitHub Yeah, Airbnb Coinbase damn Don't even- Oh hey, okay, good. DHH mentioned. Okay, just make it sure Just make it sure we mentioned DHH Shopify Twitch Soundcloud And many more A lot of it's popular I can't be true anymore I thought that was contrary Full stack websites Full stack is the combination of the front end And the back end The rolling over website A website's front end is basically Everything you can see with your eyes Basically the entire interface The text, the images, the buttons And the videos are all part of the front end The back end is the non-visual part of the website Which is mainly the servers and databases Account information, authentication And data storage is what's putt of the back end Java Remember that I'm some program Flip zoom in Is asked you to install on your computer? Yeah, that's an actual programming language It gained popularity immediately after its released And it's still popular today A big advantage that- People forget, and for those that are frequent My channel don't forget But a lot of people do forget that Java And JavaScript made a co-announcement Do you guys remember that the release of Java And the release of Java's web And the release of JavaScript All together That Java has- Right And allows you to create programs that are very platform independent That's because Java can be compiled Into bytecode which can be understood by many operating systems All your computer- Yep Right once to bug everywhere Right Can I hear your voice? Do this Which is what you're installing every time you computer asks you to install Java Java can be used to create many things Like video games such as Minecraft Or mobile apps on Android A meme amongst beginner programmers Is that Java's code tends to be pre-verbose Or a programming link I don't think that's a meme I think that's just- Reality Isn't that just- I mean that's- That's just fact of life No one's alleging that Java's verbose It is verbose There's no alleging There's no allegedly So here Okay, there's not a memory Or this- This is memory This is not a courtroom Okay T- In which it's- All right let's go Main purpose is the districts It's a widely popular programming language Use to organize data and data visualization It's very useful for researchers conducting epidemiological- Wydely is a unique term I do not believe it's widely The studies If you're a researcher Studying in fields such as economics, psychology, biology, medicine, etc Learning how to code an either Python or R Is a very useful skill Java's script I love it It's not the same as Java In fact it has- Ah yeah it is They both have null The same thing Nothing to do with Java Java's script is- That's actually not true Ah the null was included in JavaScript Specifically to interrupt with Java In fact, JavaScript Had requirements due to- I'm just saying It's- To say it's not- It's- There's nothing alike It's- It's a little bit of a lie Okay, it's a little bit of a lie Just saying Can I rewind that for a quick second? Java In fact it has nothing to do with Java JavaScript is a programming language that is mainly only used in web browsers Someone's gonna be upset when they hear about node In fact, 98% of the internet uses JavaScript JavaScript is responsible for the- Main functional aspect of the website It's based on the ECMA script standard And is often- Yeah Remember when Microsoft held down the ECMA script standard for like a decade Because they wanted a competitive advantage Remember Microsoft how they- How they've done shady- Business dealings with everything they've ever touched ever And now you guys just let them run for free on your system In a program called VSCut TML and CSS But sometimes you can create websites with this pure JavaScript Using frameworks such as React And with React mobile, you can create mobile apps HTML and CSS HTML and CSS are both scripting languages to create websites HTML He did it again HTML has a programming language, okay It has always been a programming language And if you guys aren't willing to accept that I-I-I think you're just- I-I think you're ignorant, okay Okay, it's 2024 It's time to exit That's a tweet That is such a tweet It's such a tweet It's such a tweet It's 2024 It's time It's time you accept HTML as a programming language Boom And tweet that one All right, let's go back to this video All right We're back in Now deals with the pure content and structure of the website It uses code- It's beautiful HTML tags In order to build the content on the web page It's VSS is used for the design Or aesthetic look of the website Do you love how we used Uh, on-on ordered lists To put in ordered items Isn't that just like the greatest thing ever With HTML that-that just-on ordered lists Are the list of ordered items It just makes me so happy It deals with the arrangement of content Colors, borders, gradients, opacities And can even perform anime Really makes the Hp, okay Hp, aka, person No, no, no, no one uses ordered lists, okay That's-that's ridiculous, okay No one uses an O-L We all use U-Ls No homepage But sometimes, alternate It is ordered un-orderly Unordered lists, everybody It's called Hypertext Pre-Processor It's a programming language mainly used on web servers You can actually embed- Let's go PHP Directly into HTML Let's go PHP Although winning in popularity Is still the backbone of many major websites today PHP is a great language And as I mentioned earlier And I'm gonna mention again, okay Okay I'm gonna mention this again, you know why Because we are Yeah I'm giving a 15-minute talk At-lar-apparently my computer Is just not loading things anymore Laricon 15 minutes This guy Right here Okay We're definitely gonna have to do an intro video We're-they're gonna drive me in They're gonna drive me in in the Lambo Me and Taylor Me and Tate Me and Tate Swiftly We'll drive in Ah, very excited about the whole situation It was the language Mark Zuckerberg first built Facebook in Action script A language based on JavaScript Who didn't do a little bit of action script There was a-there was a thing for a while called Radatouille I believe was its name Or something along those lines And it was a The ability to run Action script in the browser By compiling it to JavaScript And having an entire ecosystem around it This was like in 2011 I believe it died But nonetheless It was real Action script People love Action script Have you ever played a flash game back in the day That was most likely made using Action script It was made by Pop-and-one Everybody loves Like I have never met somebody that hated Ah, Action script It seems like Action script was actually really good Really good language I kind of feel sad that I didn't know About Action script Yeah, I'm pausing it I'm pausing it on C I'm pausing it on C-sharp Just because I know it's obviously the greatest language in this list Ming language meet in the early 2000s by Microsoft It was influenced by C++ and Java C-sharp's most common uses are Being used in web servers with the .net framework And video game Let's go Mentioned ii-i-s Mentioned Wait Yeah ii-i-s Let's go Let's go The greatest web server of all time Known for its ease of use And It's friendly developer outlook Game development with the Unity Engine Scala, Scala was made as an alternative to Java That's the end of C-sharp everybody Unity and ii-i-s Um, yeah that seems about right They didn't even mention X and A It's a revolutionary counterpart for developing video games for the Xbox And Zoon handheld Which came in everybody's favorite colors such as brown Java, it also uses many of Java's scene technologies Such as the Java Virtual Machine But unlike Java, it has many features of functional programming PowerShell Basically, it's called the Windows command line on steroids Also people love PowerShell Everyone says that PowerShell really is super awesome Is that true? Production level read the manual But its own scripting language F-sharp F-sharp is the system language to C-sharp With the difference of it being able to support functional programming I thought F-sharp was like O-camel I thought F-sharp was Microsoft O-camel I thought F-sharp was literally what Java is to C-sharp as O-camel is to F-sharp Julia, a programming language made in the early 12 games In order to perform a panel of applications Data analysis and visualization Everyone seems to love It's mean advantage Julia, that it's much faster than the other Julia loves Julia The code is a lot easier to read and it's much easier to learn Elm A programming language designed to create graphical user interfaces For websites It can be compiled in the I heard Elm is awesome and I believe Charm uses an Elm-like pattern To be able to do its interfacing And I'm going to be doing some Charm here shortly on on stream I'm going to be doing a bunch of Charm on stream And I know I'll be doing a lot of Elm-like patterns Every time I've used it, it's pretty cool It's pretty cool stuff, you hate it Elm Yeah, that's Charming Shut up I'll be doing an SSH client for VIM APM JavaScript, NIM A programming language with its input NIM NIM NIM NIM NIM Dude, I swear people that love NIM Absolute brain disorder Absolutely Very Like, love it Just Just absolutely problems going on upstairs It's crazy It's crazy A language for Gremlins is what you should say Because that was one of its most famous articles Raku A language for Gremlins Raku A language for Gremlins Which you can redefine anything Literally It's a language for Gremlins Okay I didn't- I'm not just making these things up It's just- this is life This is the life you need to live Is to learn It's basically Pearl, but version 6 Although it has a pretty wacky logo Scratch A programming language made in MIT That is completely visual and block-based No, seriously Let's go Great for kids Together like Lego blocks It was made with the purpose We're teaching children how to code Despite it- My kids use it It's great It's pretty complex things with it Go Formerly known as Golan Let's go C2.0 C2.0 Let's go I like go Greatest part about go No colored functions Let's go It's a mainly used in service with framework Worst part about go It's not as complex as rust Best part about go It's not as complex as rust Think about it It's like Docker Holy See A programming language created by Terry A. Davis in 2005 Made with assembly It was used to create an operating system called Temple OS An operating system inspired by a revelation from God The main interest in this programming language is due to the backstory of the developer Although being a talented programmer Suffered from And ultimately succumbed from his battle with schizophrenia Kotlin Known as the RIP Terry I'm glad that after that Sage moment talking about Terry We are now going to go to the only programming language which also Doubles as a desnets joke RIP Terry And Kotlin desnets Let's go Easier form of Java is a language used to create mobile apps on Android OS The most popular IDE the code Kotlin in is Android Studio TypeScript basically JavaScript But with static typing Dart A programming link No No it's JavaScript with a linter Which created by Google that you can use to create web applications Or mobile apps using the flutter framework Swift Developed Flutter these nuts also works really well By Apple to replace objective C It is the standard programming which to create anything in iOS And it comes with its own code editor called Xcode I wish Apple wasn't such a dick And would just Make Swift usable on not stupid as Xcode Like I think Xcode should just be there And not so much of a requirement I just want to like I would program a lot more Swift I think If it wasn't so Geared towards working in this one one walled garden Swift looks like a cool language You can only code in Swift if you have an Apple computer or use a virtual machine Rust Okay this is the Let it out everybody Let it out Let it out everybody come on Let it out Rust mention Let's go Let's go Let's go Rust mentioned I know Boo Rust Elp rust is a great language True modern version of CNC++ It is not a modern version of CNC++ Good if you want to write simple code while also handling memory issues It's a very popular programming language And it's used to make applications where performance is extremely important Such as game engines or operating systems Solidarity A programming language created with the Ethereum technique Programs created in solidity are called smart contracts These smart tracks are later deployed to the blockchain However, once smart contracts are deployed to the blockchain They cannot be changed or altered again So before a contract is deployed That's why you gotta use the diamond pattern Usually developers test them thoroughly beforehand This is done using You just say developers trust that Test them thoroughly Come on We will go on We're all developers here Okay you know You know You know we ain't tested shit With Truffle or Hardhat Okay Testing environments such as Truffle and Hardhat Depending on the smart contract Can cost memory and even money in the form of a memory Test game Its main uses are for creating ribs Solid I like the fact that they did a solidity programming app And then he puts Solana Which uses rust Right? Doesn't Solana use rust Isn't it kind of funny Kind of funny I don't know kind of funny Decentralized finance applications Or DeFi To even your own tokens or NFTs The type of smart contract you'll make Will depend on the ERC format you're adhering to ERC standing for Ethereum Recrease for Comment Elixir A popular I was gonna make another comment But we're on to Elixir Okay Brazil mentioned again We got two Brazils Let's go Let's go Elixir Brazil mentioned Jose Let's go Jose Oh my goodness So good Yes I'm glad I see Ryan Winchester Already got a comment deleted What did he say Elixir? Elixir? Elixir? Yeah, delete that shit Get him clean out of here Peace go good moose That was created in Brazil It runs on the Erlang Beam virtual machine Erlang mentioned Let's go Erlang Erlang Erlang Erlang Erlang Yeah, I can't delete that one Can you please go You can do with Elixir The same things you can do with Erlang The language is commonly used for telecom e-commerce And finance Zig Is that true Ryan Winchester I didn't realize it was used for telecom You've been telling me it's been used for For Servers This whole time I feel like too By the way, we're in the ZIG Let's go Andrew Kelly Let's go Andrew Kelly I'm not coming language intended to be the success ZIG is the true C C plus plus Successor I'm saying it There you go I said I said it ZIG Is the truest successor To C There has I think ever been You said go was Go is C 2.0 It's a difference Okay, it's a difference Goes electric boogaloo of C Okay, there's a big difference between being the the electric boogaloo Where ZIG is just C Just nicer It's it's it's like everything you've ever wanted In a C like thing Tweet it or fake take Tweet it or fake take Boom I'll say I'll say that You think you think you think you Dude you realize my My editor who's editing this video just laid down the most offensive to tweet To date and you're saying that we're worried about saying that ZIG Is a modern C ZIG is a better at a modern C Then C plus plus or rust boom tweet that ZIG should honestly I think ZIG should have been the one that went into Linux more than um rust Yeah, I also just said that out loud false just saying it's it's it's it's it's really it's an it's an incredible language Cessar of C it was created in the mid 2010s and it's slowly gaining popularity Microsoft power FX a language created in 2021 wait you didn't end on ZIG you end on Microsoft power FX What the hell are you doing by Microsoft it is used in a low code program called power apps A low code program is a program that allows you to create applications with little to no code But if you want to add extra logic or functionality to your app it would be using the power FX Also the language is based on Microsoft itself You should share this video and thanks for I thought excel was visual basic of some sort okay Holy cow That video had a lot of stuff in it I actually like that video. You know what? I liked the video. I'm gonna subscribe. I thought it was a good job I like went over so many great languages in there a lot. I didn't know about a lot of some that I did know about I mean how else do you do That many programming languages is in 15 minutes. That was absolutely fantastic huge fan of ZIG though. I loved ZIG I love I love ZIG I want to do more ZIG But I unfortunately also want to be able to program things to completion. So I'm just choosing go You know what I mean? I'm tired of do I'm tired Of rust I think I've done enough rust. I've done two years straight of rust for all my side projects and all my little tools I built at Netflix and all that kind of stuff It's time for something different. I'm gonna try out go for a year and really give it a more solid attempt as opposed to doing it for a week Completing what I was trying to build and then never using it again because I'd rather go struggle with something else You know what I mean? I'm gonna actually I'm actually gonna do more things and go hey the name is the go-it-gen. Okay
